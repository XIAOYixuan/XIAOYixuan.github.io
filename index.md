 I am currently a PhD student at the University of Stuttgart, supervised by Prof. Dr. [Thang Vu](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/team/Vu-00002/). My research interests lie in speech processing tasks such as audio deepfake detection and speech synthesis. My contact info can be found [here](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/team/Xiao-00007/).
I received my M.Sc. in Computational Linguistics, also from the University of Stuttgart. My Master's thesis was titled “Mitigating Text Domain Mismatch in ASR Systems through Prompt-based Learning” and supervised by Prof. Dr. [Thang Vu](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/team/Vu-00002/). 

Prior to this, I worked as a senior algorithm engineer at Baidu's Speech Team (specialized in high-performance computing) and at NetEase Youdao's AI Team (specialized in ASR and computer-aided pronunciation training). Earlier, I completed a taught Master's programme in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh and a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Technology at Beijing's Institute of Technology, supervised by Prof. [Dr. Xianling Mao](https://cs.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/bssds/6e14806577d145b886e02f7eb14157ba.htm).

## Supervision
Message for students (Uni Stuttgart); 

### Thesis Topics
I supervise the following topics:

1. Audio Deepfake Detection: Model training and analysis; requires familiarity with our codebase [IMS-ADD](https://github.com/XIAOYixuan/IMS-ADD/tree/codec-add).  
2. Codec-based Speech Synthesis: Prompting and fine-tuning TTS or ALM models; audio reconstruction using neural audio codecs.  
3. Speech Analysis: Analyzing speech to better understand speech models. Example tools include `librosa`, `openSMILE`, `Parselmouth`, `speechmetrics`, and `SpeechBrain`. Relevant models can sometimes be found on HuggingFace, e.g., speech enhancement models.  

**Availability**

My schedule will be very tight from September 2025 to March 2026. During this period, I won't be able to provide close, hands-on supervision. But new thesis projects are possible under the following conditions:

1. You are confident that the project will not be overly challenging for you, so you only need high-level guidance.
2. You are preparing an industry paper with a supervisor from the company, and mainly need support from me with the writing process.  

In short, I will likely not have the time to provide detailed help. I encourage you to select a topic that aligns with your strengths. 
Please DO NOT choose a challenging topic and assume AI tools can solve these issues! Based on past experience, AI (chatbots or editors) often suggests quick fixes to the codebase. Once these pile up, the project becomes messy and ugly and unmanagable, so everyone suffers. 

If you would like to do a thesis with me, to help me assess whether a topic might be too challenging, please contact me with your topic preference and a self introduction (e.g., your background, CV, etc.). 

### HiWi Position

Currently, all positions are filled (three HiWi contracts). If new openings become available, I'll post updates here.
