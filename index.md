 I am currently a PhD student at the University of Stuttgart, supervised by Prof. Dr. [Thang Vu](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/team/Vu-00002/). My research interests lie in speech processing tasks such as audio deepfake detection and speech synthesis. My contact info can be found [here](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/team/Xiao-00007/).
I received my M.Sc. in Computational Linguistics, also from the University of Stuttgart. My Master's thesis was titled “Mitigating Text Domain Mismatch in ASR Systems through Prompt-based Learning” and supervised by Prof. Dr. [Thang Vu](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/team/Vu-00002/). 

Prior to this, I worked as a senior algorithm engineer at Baidu's Speech Team (specialized in high-performance computing) and at NetEase Youdao's AI Team (specialized in ASR and computer-aided pronunciation training). Earlier, I completed a taught Master's programme in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh and a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Technology at Beijing's Institute of Technology, supervised by Prof. [Dr. Xianling Mao](https://cs.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/bssds/6e14806577d145b886e02f7eb14157ba.htm).
