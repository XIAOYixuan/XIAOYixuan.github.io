title: Recent LLM-based Speech Synthesis (2024 - Present)
---

The page is under construction.

Motivation: To better design the deepfake detection model, it's important to understand the recent LLM-based speech synthesis models.
So even though the field is speech synthesis, I will focus on aspects that I think are important for the deepfake detection task.
Four aspects are considered:
1. The architecture design. 
2. The training data. 
3. Waveform generation method. e.g., is it generated by a GAN-based vocoder or no stand-alone vocoder is needed?
4. Audio scope. e.g., can it generate speech-only audio or can cover a broader scope such as background sounds that mimic a scene.
